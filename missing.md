# Not seeing a candidate listed?



![oops](https://media.tenor.com/images/aadb99c4aece44af2a00e9566e0aa798/tenor.gif)



Please send a tweet to me describing which candidate is missing from the list and I'll look into adding them.

I try to keep up with all the declared candidates but sometime I may miss some, I promise I'm not excluding someone to further my own agenda.

### Thanks in advance
