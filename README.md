# About this app

## Purpose and Goal

This app was created with the intention of getting a better understanding of the sentiment towards and surronding presedential candidates of the 2020 election for the Unites States of America.

This app is, in a way, tracking the candidate popularity. Favorite and retweet counts are a somewhat reasonable measure of how the public feels about a candidates message.
